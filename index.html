				According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/covid-19-spending-helped-to-lift-foreign-aid-to-an-all-time-high-in-2020-but-more-effort-needed.htm">OECD</a>), this is the level of foreign aid as of year 2020 (The year of COVID-19 pandemic). It is an increase of about 3.5% from 2019 levels and the highest level yet.

			<h1>The Problem?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 text-start">
			<p class="fs-2" align="justify">
				Inspite of this increase in foreign aid generosity, questions about the its effectiveness of foreign aid continues
				to be asked because of the persistence of problems into which much fund had be sunk in the past. This may be driving
				some developed nations to cut-back on the level of aid they are willing to provide in the future.
				<em><b>The challenge of ensuring foreign aid effectiveness is in large part due to its use mosty for implementing band-aid
				sort of solutions, which are quick fixes that are often unsustainable</b>.</em>

				At Gutenkraft, we believe the <em><b>lack of approprate technological and other base infrastructures (both at individual and communal levels) is a key
