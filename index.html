		<h1 class="text-center">The Problem.</h1>

		<p class="fs-2" align="justify">
			Technology infrastructures can be unweildy (bulky) and difficult to deploy and maintain. The great capital cost for their entire life cycle, results in their neglect in favour of easy (often short-term and less impactful) remedies to national needs.

		<h1 class="text-center">What We Think.</h1>

		<p class="fs-2" align="justify">
			At Gutenkraft, we believe the lack of necessary technological facilities in developing and under-developed nations, makes them  unable to attract and effectively utilize capital, needed to drive sustainable development and improved quality of life. We think key technology infrastructures need a pragmatic rethink that considers the reality on ground in these nations.
