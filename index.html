			According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/covid-19-spending-helped-to-lift-foreign-aid-to-an-all-time-high-in-2020-but-more-effort-needed.htm">OECD</a>), this is the level of foreign aid as of year 2020 (The year of COVID-19 pandemic). It is an increase of about 3.5% from 2019 levels and the highest level yet.

		Developed countries are increasingly generous to developing nations. In fact, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/covid-19-spending-helped-to-lift-foreign-aid-to-an-all-time-high-in-2020-but-more-effort-needed.htm">OECD</a>), foreign aid increased by about 3.5% from 2019 levels to its highest level yet of over <em>$161 billion</em> in 2020 (The year of COVID-19 pandemic). Inspite of this increase in generosity, questions about the effectiveness of foreign aid persists and may be driving some developed nations to cut-back on the level of aid they are willing to provide in the future.

			This challenge of ensuring foreign aid effectiveness is in large part due to its use mosty for implementing band-aid sort of solutions, which are quick temporary fix that are often unsustainable.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			At Gutenkraft, we believe the lack of approprate technological and other base infrastures (both at individual and communal levels) is a key reason why these unsustainable quick fix approaches to foreign aid, are common and thus ineffective. <br> 
			Driven by the desire to make foreign aid effective as well as a tool to enable self-sufficiency of developing nations,   <em>Gutenkraft Labs is set-up as a non-profit technology research and development (R&D) outfit focused exclusively on
			designing, developing and deploying building blocks of necessary technological infrastructures needed to drive growth
			and improve quality of life in developing nations</em>. This focus is codified in Gutenkraft's mission and vision.
