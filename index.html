	<h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Gutenkraft</h1>

	<p class="text-center">
		Gutenkraft is a non-profit technology research and development (R&D) outfit focused on crafting and deploying sustainable technology infrastructures, to drive development and improve quality of life in developing nations. <br>
		Her focus is on <em>rethinking technology infrastructures for developing nations</em> to reduce the barrier to large scale sustainable deployment.

	<h1 class="text-center">The Problem.</h1>

	<p class="fs-2" align="justify">
		Technology infrastructures can be unweildy, difficult to deploy and maintain. This implies that with the current approach, great capital cost is involved for the entire life cycle of the infrastructure hardware. Given the high deployment and maintenance cost, they are often consigned as oppotunity cost to attending to other easy to solve national needs in developing nations. 

		<!-- According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a
			href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/covid-19-spending-helped-to-lift-foreign-aid-to-an-all-time-high-in-2020-but-more-effort-needed.htm">OECD</a>),
		this is the level of foreign aid as of year 2020 (The year of COVID-19 pandemic) was $161.2 billion. This
		was an increase of about 3.5% from 2019 levels and the highest level yet.
		Inspite of this increase in generosity, questions continues
		to be asked about the effectiveness of foreign aid because of the persistence of problems into which much
		fund had been sunk in the past.
		<em><b>The challenge of ensuring foreign aid effectiveness is in large part due to its use mosty for implementing band-aid sort of solutions, which are often unsustainable quick fixes </b>.</em> -->

	<h1 class="text-center">What We Think.</h1>

	<p class="fs-2" align="justify">
		At Gutenkraft, we believe the lack of necessary technology facilities in developing and under-developed nations, makes them  unable to attract and effectively utilize capital (from
		foreign and local investment as well as foreign aid) to drive sustainable development and improved quality of life. We think key technology infrastructures need a pragmatic rethink that considers the reality on ground in developing and under-developed nations.

		<!-- At Gutenkraft, we believe the <em><b>lack of necessary growth infrastructures (both at individual and communal levels), is a key factor</b></em> responsible for driving these unsustainable quick fix approaches to foreign aid deployment. -->
