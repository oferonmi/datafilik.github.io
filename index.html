		<h1 class="text-center">The Problem.</h1>

		<p class="fs-2" align="justify">
			Technology infrastructures can be unweildy, difficult to deploy and maintain. This implies that with the current approach, great capital cost is involved for the entire life cycle of the infrastructure hardware. Given the high deployment and maintenance cost, they become the opportunity cost of attending to other easy-to-solve (often short term impact) national needs in developing nations.

		<h1 class="text-center">What We Think.</h1>

		<p class="fs-2" align="justify">
			At Gutenkraft, we believe the lack of necessary technological facilities in developing and under-developed nations, makes them  unable to attract and effectively utilize capital (from
			foreign/local investment as well as foreign aid), needed to drive sustainable development and improved quality of life. We think key technology infrastructures need a pragmatic rethink that considers the reality on ground in developing and under-developed nations.
