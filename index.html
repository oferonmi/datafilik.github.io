		<div class="col-9 text-start">
			<p class="fs-2" align="justify">
				According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a
					href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/covid-19-spending-helped-to-lift-foreign-aid-to-an-all-time-high-in-2020-but-more-effort-needed.htm">OECD</a>),
				this is the level of foreign aid as of year 2020 (The year of COVID-19 pandemic) was $161.2 billion. This
				was an increase of about 3.5% from 2019 levels and the highest level yet.
				Inspite of this increase in generosity, questions continues
				to be asked about the effectiveness of foreign aid because of the persistence of problems into which much
				fund had been sunk in the past.
				<em><b>The challenge of ensuring foreign aid effectiveness is in large part due to its use mosty for implementing band-aid sort of solutions, which are often unsustainable quick fixes </b>.</em>

				At Gutenkraft, we believe the <em><b>lack of necessary growth infrastructures (both at individual and
