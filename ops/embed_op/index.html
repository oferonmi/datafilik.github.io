    <h1>Embedded Ops</h1>

    <p align="justify">
        The  embedded ops unit focuses on the development of electronic solutions involving the cobbling together of hardware and software to create systems that specialize in doing a specifc task. Today, embedded systems are central to the functionality of tools needed for smooth human day to day operations from those in microwave ovens, washing machines, smartphones to those in cars, industial machines and avionics in aeroplanes. Embedded systems are almost always present and their ubiquity is about to be turbo-charged by mass adoption of the Internet of things (IoTs) at the heart of smart systems (such as smart cities and smart electricity grids) as wells as in Industry 4.0 applications supported by super wireless networks from 5G and beyond. The quick response time and clean nature of electronic systems over mechnical systems has given them an overwhelming command of domestic systems as well as a significant hold (along side pneumatic systems) in industrial controls systems.
        Embedded systems (which are electronic at heart) are important for the development of electronics based solutions.

    <p align="justify">
        In view of the centrality of embedded systems to electronics solutions, the embedded ops unit's objective is <em>to develop/muster and deploy embedded systems skills to solve the problem at the heart of a Gutenkraft project where needed</em>.

    <p align="justify">
        Focus areas for the op unit include the application of custom or off-the-shelf electronic hardware such as,
