    <h1>Embedded Ops</h1>

    <p align="justify">
        The  embedded ops focuses the development of electronic solutions. Today, embedded systems are central to the functionality of tools needed for smooth human day to day operations from those in microwave ovens, washing machines, smartphones to those in cars, industial machines and avionics in aeroplanes. Embedded systems are almost always present and their ubiquity is about to be turbo-charged by mass adoption of the Internet of things (IoTs) at the heart of smart systems (such as smart cities and smart electricity grids) as wells as in Industry 4.0 applications supported by super wireless networks from 5G and beyond. The quick response time and clean nature of electronic systems over mechnical systems has given them an overwhelming command of domestic systems as well as a significant hold (along side pneumatic systems) in industrial controls systems.
        Embedded systems (which are electronic at heart) are important for the development of electronics based solutions.

    <p align="justify">
        In view of the centrality of embedded systems to electronics solutions, the embedded ops unit's objective is <em>to develop/muster and deploy embedded systems skills to solve the problem at the heart of a Gutekraft project where needed</em>. 
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Focus areas for the op unit include the application of custom or off-the-shelf electronic hardware such as,
    </p>

    <ul class = "embedtools">
        <li>Electronic prototyping boards and single board or system on chip (SoC) computers,</li>
        <li>Application specific integrated chips (ASICs) boards and</li>
        <li>Field programmable gate array (FPGA) boards</li>
    </ul>

    <p align="justify">
        as well as using any real-time operating systems (RTOS) softwares such as
    </p>

    <ul class = "embedtools">
        <li><a href="https://elinux.org/Main_Page">Embedded Linux</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freertos.org/index.html">FreeRTOS</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a> and,</li>
        <li>any other promising RTOS</li>
    </ul>

    <p align="justify">
        and embedded system application software programming tools such as
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Embedded C,</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust language</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)">Qt</a>,</li>
        <li>Python language? (Yes that Python) and</li>
        <li>Hardware description languages (HDL) such as Verilog and VHDL</li>
    </ul> 

    <p align="justify">
        All of the above mentioned focus areas would be geared towards developing reliable and low cost electronic solutions.
