    <h1>Embedded Ops</h1>
    <p align="justify">
        The  embedded ops focuses on the application of custom or off-the-shelf electronic prototyping boards, single board computers or system on chip (SoC) as well as Application specific integrated chips (ASICs) and Field programmable gate array (FPGA) boards for development of hardware solutions.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Embedded systems are crucial to ensuring smooth human day to day operations. From those in microwave ovens, washing machines to those in cars, industial machines and avionics in aeroplanes. Embedded systems are almost always present and their ubiquity is about to be turbo-charged by the Internet of things (IoTs) which is central to smart systems (such as smart cities and electricity grid) as wells as in Industy 4.0.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        The quick response time of electronic systems over mechnical systems and their amenability to remote operation has given embedded systems a sure footing in domestic systems as well as in industrial controls systems along side pneumatic systems.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        The embedded ops unit is focused on developing and mustering embedded systems skills to serve to meet the goal of a
        project undertaken by Gutenkraft.
