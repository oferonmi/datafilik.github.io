    <h1>Signal and Connectivity (S&C) Ops</h1>
    <p align="justify">
        This operational focus area is concerned with <em>developing novel processing technique</em> for aquired and/or fused signals from sensors in communication and wireless sensor networks. 
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Also, this op focuses on <em>exploring frontiers in the development and deployment of hybrid architectures for machine networks</em>. Hybrid architecture are modular in nature and thus can operate in centralized as well as a descentralized mode. Blockchains and other peer-to-peer systems already provide certain foundations that can be built upon for creating decentralized systems.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        We hybrid network allows for creating robust machine networks that take advantage of the resilence of decentralized systems as well as the efficiency of centralized systems.
