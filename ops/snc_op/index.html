    <h1>Signal and Connectivity (S&C) Ops</h1>
    <p align="justify">
        This op's key focus is on <em>investigating and developing novel techniques for acquisition, fusion, processing, transmission and reception of telemetric and communcation signals in <b>smart systems or networks</b> (Like smart grids, smart cities, etc.)</em>. 
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Futhermore, it will <em>explore frontiers in the development and deployment of <b>smart hybrid machine network architectures</b></em>. Hybrid architecture are modular in nature can operate in a centralized as well as a descentralized mode. Blockchains and other peer-to-peer systems already provide certain foundations that can be built upon for creating such systems.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Smart hybrid networks could be crucial to creating robust machine networks that take advantage of the resilence of decentralized systems as well as the efficiency of centralized systems.
