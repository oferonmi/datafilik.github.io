    <h1>Signal and Connectivity (S&C) Ops</h1>
    <p align="justify">
        This op's key focus is on <em>investigating and developing novel techniques for acquisition, fusion, processing, transmission and reception of telemetric and communcation signals</em> in <b>smart network systems (SNS)</b> and to <em> explore frontiers in the development and deployment of <b>hybrid network architectures</b></em>.  
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Smart networks refer to <em>cognitive networks, smart grids / cities and Industry 4.0 systems etc</em>. The current focus is on enabling the utility of really high frequency bands (such as Millimetre wave (mmWave) & Tetrahertz (THz) wave band) for broadband wireless access in such networks by the application of machine learning (ML) principles and algorithms.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Hybrid networks are modular in nature and can operate in a centralized as well as a descentralized mode. Blockchains and other peer-to-peer(P2P) systems and protocols already provide proven foundations that can be built upon for creating such systems.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Smart hybrid networks could be crucial to creating robust and self-adapting machine networks that actively takes advantage of the resilence of decentralized systems as well as the efficiency of centralized systems. We refer to such networks as Fluid Initiative Networks (FIN) system.
