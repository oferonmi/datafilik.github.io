    <h1>Signal and Connectivity (S&C) Ops</h1>
    <p align="justify">
        This op's key focus is on <em>investigating and developing novel techniques for acquisition, fusion, processing, transmission and reception of telemetric and communcation signals in <b>smart network systems (SNS)</b> like smart grids, smart cities, Industry 4.0 etc</em>. The current focus on enabling high frequency bands  such as Millimetre wave (mmWave) & Tetrahertz (THz) wave band for broadband wireless terrestial networks.  
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Futhermore, it will <em>explore frontiers in the development and deployment of <b>hybrid network architectures</b></em>. Hybrid networks are modular in nature and can operate in a centralized as well as a descentralized mode. Blockchains and other peer-to-peer(P2P) systems and protocols already provide certain foundations that can be built upon for creating such systems.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Smart hybrid networks could be crucial to creating robust machine networks that take advantage of the resilence of decentralized systems as well as the efficiency of centralized systems.
