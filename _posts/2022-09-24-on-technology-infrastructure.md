        Typically when one thinks about infrastructure, they think hardware that are needed to perform tasks, usually of signifcant scope. But infrastructure encompasses all basic facilities / systems that augment and enable various functionalities for individual and communal entities. There are crucial to communal sustainability and advancement. Also, their proliferation at a location, are usually an indication of economic growth since there play a key role in accelerating it.

    <p align="justify"> 
        Technology on the other hand, is the outcome of aggregated and refined knowledge (implicit or tacit in nature), expressed in the form of skills applied in devising methods, algorithm and processes of practical utility. The integration of various technologies produces tools and machineries that makes it easy to do useful work.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Taking the above concepts together, one could say the term 'technology infrastructure' refers to basic facilities or systems that aid the development of technological solutions. Put another way, technology infrastructure is the system that produces technologies as well as the tools and machines which are the product of the integration of developed technologies.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        The question then is, what specifically are these facilities that enables the churning out of technological systems. Framed another way, one could ask what basic facilities are crucial for translating  aggregated knowledge into useful methods, algorithms and processes as well as what systems enable their combination to produce tools, machines or other systems for doing useful work.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Another question bothers on whether current technology infrastructures need a rethink or modification along the lines of cost-effectiveness, sustainability  and scalability, inorder to make them more accessible.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        The first question (on the basic facilities that constitute technology infrastructures) has been the focus of the field of innovation studies such as the National Innovation System (NIS) and Technology Innovation System (TIS).
        NIS focuses on the collection of institutions (both public and private) in a country whose isolated and collective activities leads to the generation and proliferation of technological artifacts (that is tools, machines, systems etc.). 
        On the other hand, TIS focuses not just on the institutions, but also on the actors within these institutions together with the artifacts that facilitates their interaction and activities in the acquisition and transmission of knowledge within a group or network. TIS is concerned with functions related to the development of knowledge, itâ€™s proliferation in a synergistic network and the agenda that drives it. The role of enterprising minds (entrepreneurs) is highlighted and identified as expressed in faculties for recognizing and proving the practical usefulness of developed knowledge through experimentation and demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Furthermore, TIS considers practical functionalities in the creation of market opportunities, mustering of necessary resources  as well as mechanisms for offence and defense against entrenched interests who may consider the emergence of novel technology or new player in the marrket, as a treat. Such mechanisms may be in the form of political lobbies, policy advice on behalf of the interest group associated with the new technology/industry. Also, legal challenges could be deployed to deter or reverse questionable approaches that may be or have been resorted to by incumbent interests in the bid to stymie the progress of the new technology and to keep out new players. Continuous and bold  research and development (R&D) efforts could also be considered one such mechanism for offense and defense, as it ensures possession of the cutting edge features that are most likely (based on their functional merit and usefulness) to displace old technology on the market.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Thus, from the perspective of NIS and TIS, basic facilities for a technology infrastructure include, learning systems, idea exchange and collaborative networks, enterprising minds, resource mobilization, mission  orienting, incentivization (by government institutions and private firms)  and advocacy systems.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Considering the organization and operation of the above mentioned  facilities from the perspective of our hyper-connected and digitized world reveal opportunities for setting up nuanced, sustainable and efficient technology infrastructures, especially in developing nations. This provides grounds for the rethink of technology infrastructure, which currently mostly unweildy (bulky), costly and difficult to maitain.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">   
        The internet has been instrumental to reducing/removing barriers to large scale operation and collaboration. This much is evident in the management and operation of open-source projects and the 3D maker movement. For instance, in terms of resource mobilization, blockchains  have added further strength to crowdfunding as an addition to and more accessible systems for raising finiacial capital as was denmonstrated in the issuance of cryptographic and governance tokens via initial coin offerings (ICO) that launched various cryptocurrency projects. Crowdfunding, in and of itself, presented a new approach to raise initial capital from a commons of global scope as was most aptly seen in the development of the Oculus Rift, the Pebble smart watch and a host of other projects. In terms of human capital, this can now be sourced and organized over various geographical locations using the internet. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the internet (specifically social network services) for advocacy ends, is proven as revealed in the Arab springs, grassroot political campaigns and the GameStop short squeeze by retail investors. The efficacy of social mobiliztion though relies on many loose variables (such as the right environment, community coherence etc.) which need to hold for them to be effective.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">  
        Systems that reconsider the development of technology infrastructure components to  take advantage of the scale, speed, collaboration potential, moularity and hyperconnectivity of the internet, digitization  and then some, present an approach from which to rethink technology infrastructures to make them nimble  and sustainable systems. Gutenkraft Labs seeks to do just that.
