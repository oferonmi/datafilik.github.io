        Infrastructure refers to basic facilities / systems that enables the functionality of individual and communal entities. There are crucial to communal sustainability and are considered an important factor that influences economic growth.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Technology is the outcome of aggregated and refined knowledge (implicit or tacit in nature), expressed in the form of skills applied in devising methods, algorithm and processes of practical utility. The integration of various technologies produces tools and machineries that makes it easy to do useful work.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Thus one could say the term technology infrastructure is a refers to basic facilities or systems that aid the development of technological solutions. This includes the tools and machines that can be produced by the integration of developed technologies.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        The question then is, what specifically the facilities are, that enable technology development. Framed another way, one could ask what basic facilities are crucial for translating  aggregated knowledge into useful methods, algorithms and processes as well as their combination to produce tools, machines or other systems for doing useful work.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Another question bothers on whether current technology infrastructures need a rethink or modification to make them more accessible by virtue of incorporating  cost-effectiveness, sustainability  and scalability as a whole.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        The first question (on the basic facilities that constitute technology infrastructures) has been the focus of the field of innovation studies such as the National Innovation System (NIS) and Technology Innovation System (TIS).
        NIS focuses on the collection of institutions (both public and private) in a country whose isolated and collective activities leads to the generation and proliferation of technological artifacts (such as tools machines, systems etc.). 
        On the other hand, TIS focuses not just on the institutions, but also on the actors within these institutions together with the artifacts that facilitates their interaction and activities in the acquisition and transmission of knowledge within a group or network. TIS is concerned with functions related to the development of knowledge, itâ€™s proliferation in a synergistic network and the agenda that drives it. The role of enterprising minds (entrepreneurs) is highlighted indentified as expressed in faculties for recognizing and proving the practical usefulness of developed knowledge through technological experimentation and demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Furthermore, TIS considers practical functionalities in the creation of market opportunities, mustering of necessary resources  as well as mechanism of offence and defense against entrenched interests who would consider the emergence of developed novel technology as a treat. Such mechanism could be in the form of political lobbies, policy advice on behalf of the interests associated with the new technology / industry. Also legal challenges could be deployed to deter or reverse questionable approached that may be or have been resorted to by incumbent interests in the bid to stymie the progress of the new technology and keep out new players. Continuous and bold  research and development (R&D) efforts could also be considered one such mechanism for offense and defense, as it ensures possession of the cutting edge features that are most likely (based on their functional merit and usefulness) to displace old technology on the market.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        From the consideration of NIS and TIS, basic facilities for a technology infrastructure include, learning systems, idea exchange / collaborative networks, enterprising minds, resource mustering, mission  orienting, incentivization (by government institutions and private firms)  and advocacy systems.
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> 
        Considering the organization and operation of the above mentioned  facilities from the perspective of our hyper-connected and digitized world, reveal opportunities for setting up nuanced, sustainable and efficient technology infrastructures, especially in developing nations.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">   
        The internet has been instrumental to reducing/removing barriers to large scale collaboration. This much is evident in the management and operation of open-source projects and the 3D maker movement. For instance, in terms of resource mobilization, blockchains  have added further strength to crowdfunding as an addition to systems for raising capital as was denmonstrated in the issuance of cryptographic and governance tokens via initial coin offerings (ICO) that launched various cryptocurrency projects. Crowdfunding, in and of itself, presented a new approach to raise initial capital from the a commons of global scope as was most aptly seen the development of the Oculus Rift, the Pebble smart watch an a host of other projects. In terms sof human capital, this can now be sourced and organized over various geographical locations using the internet. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the internet (specifically social network services) for advocacy ends, is proven, as revealed from the Arab springs through grassroot political campaigns to the GameStop short squeeze. The efficacy of social mobiliztion though relies on many loose variable (the right environment, community coherence etc.) that need to hold for them to be effective.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">  
        Thus, systems that reconsider the development of technology infrastructure components to  take advantage of the scale, speed, collaboration potential, moularity and hyperconnectivity of the internet, digitization  and then some, present an approach from which to rethink technology infrastructures so that nimble  and sustainable systems. Gutenkraft Labs seeks to to do just that.
